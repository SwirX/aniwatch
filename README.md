AniWatch is a simple mobile application built with Flutter that allows users to watch anime episodes conveniently on their devices. With a user-friendly interface and a vast collection of anime titles, AniWatch provides an enjoyable anime viewing experience.

## Features

- **Browse Anime Titles**: Explore a wide range of anime titles conveniently categorized for easy navigation.
- **Watch Anime Episodes**: Stream anime episodes directly within the app using the built-in video player.
- **Bookmark Favorites**: Save favorite anime series or episodes for quick access later.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for specific anime titles or episodes using the search feature.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SwirX/aniwatch.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Move into the AniWatch project directory.

   cd aniwatch
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all required dependencies are installed using Flutter.

## Alternative: Precompiled Binaries

If you prefer not to compile the source code yourself, precompiled binaries (currently only android available) are available. Simply download the binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/SwirX/aniwatch/releases) and install it to start using AniWatch immediately.

## CLI Version

For users who prefer a command-line interface (CLI) experience, an alternative CLI program [AniWatch-CLI](https://github.com/SwirX/aniwatch-cli) is available. It provides 
similar functionality to AniWatch but allows users to watch anime episodes directly from the terminal.

# ‚ö†Ô∏èImportant Notice‚ö†Ô∏è
This project has been discontinued due to some problems in the code base and how messy it is.<br>
But worry not there is a new app that continues the (short) legacy of this app.
The new app can be found [here](https://github.com/SwirX/soramai)<br>
Sorry for any inconvenience that this made, but I assure you that the new project will be much better and worth this sacrifice.<br>
And I reassure you that the new project will not die as easily as this one.<br>
Hope that everyone understandsüôè.<br>

Happy Streaming!<br>
